    <p>During a long period of praying and fasting precisely December 13 1997, on a Saturday afternoon by 1:53pm, the lord spoke to me that he called me to pioneer an aspect of his work that is to start a ministry with a church based in Osogbo Osun state and the name was given to me on 30th of May 1998.



        Prior to this time I have been on full time ministry work with Royal Chapel now Royal Breed Christian Assembly, Egbe, Kogi State.

        

        In year 2000, after Rev S.I Arobayo graciously released me from Royal Chapel, we started spade work of our ministry in a dilapidated building at Pepsi cola, Osogbo with myself, my wife, our two biological children( 4years and 2years old), and 2 brethren that followed us from Egbe. We started with a borrowed small lectern and 3 borrowed benches from a pastor friend of mine.

        

        In less than six months, we packed from that building that was about to collapse to our sitting room in power line, Osogbo to continue the ministry with my immediate family, my youngest brother and about 5 brothers and sisters living with me.

        

        However it was not until 2004 that God gave me the go ahead to officially commission the ministry which was done precisely on August 7 2004 (Saturday) in what we now refer to as “pako church”. That was a structure that we constructed with planks at the back yard of our rented 3 bedroom apartment. These place came about after we left sitting room to an uncompleted building attached to our apartment. The commissioning was done by Pastor Tayo Aremu. It was from this pako church that God move us to our present property owned by us in 2010.

        

        Where we are now, God is enlarging us from coast to coast. This church have several ministries to the youth, widows, single parent, men, women, professional and several outreaches. The ministry also have a bible school called Unity of the Spirit Ministerial School.

        

        We do hold yearly gathering called love convention. Youth camp holds yearly too. We have special programme called youth Mentoring Clinic.</p>
